# Command-Line Number Guessing Game

A fun and interactive number guessing game built with Python where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. This project demonstrates fundamental programming logic and basic error handling.

## Features

- The program generates a secret random number between 1 and 100.
- The user receives feedback ("Too high" or "Too low") on their guess.
- The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
- **Error Handling:** The program gracefully handles non-numeric user input without crashing.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Core Programming Logic: `while` loops, `if/elif/else` statements.
- User Input Handling and Type Conversion (`int()`).
- Basic Error Handling with `try-except` blocks.
- Using Python's `random` library.
